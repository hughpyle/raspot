# Hugh's raspotify config

This repo contains the configuration files for the living-room stereo.

## Hardware

Loudspeakers are early-70s Bose 901 Series II.  These need some quite dramatic EQ, which originally would
be done with the Bose equalizer box, but I'm using DSP software instead.

Amplifier is a Wadia 151, which is basically a very nice USB DAC.

The source is a Raspberry Pi.

## Software

For now, the only music source is Spotify.  Using [raspotify](https://github.com/dtcooper/raspotify),
the Raspberry Pi shows up as a Spotify Connect device.

Playback is then routed via CamillaDSP to apply EQ for the loudspeakers.

* The `/etc/default/raspotify` configuration file sets up 'raspotify' to play to the 'loopback' ALSA device,
  and adds an event handler (for notification when the track changes -- later).

* The `/lib/systemd/system/raspotify.service` configuration file sets all the environment variables and parameters
  to run 'raspotify' as a service.

* The `/var/cache/raspotify` directory has the `camilladsp` executable and configuration file.
  The DSP config in this case includes various hand-crafted artisanal IIR (biquad) filter settings
  to make the loudspeakers sound the way I want them to.
